Contains basic configuration to get you a site with:

- Sample posts and [paginated blog index](./blog/).
- Sample collection with Markdown and kramdown cheatsheets and [collection index](./cheatsheets).
- Sample `_config` with minimal configuration. `primary` color is set to <span class="text-primary">LightSkyBlue</span> and `autothemer` is enabled. [Learn how to customize your site](https://dieghernan.github.io/chulapa/docs/03-theming).
- Sample `algolia-search.yml` for using Algolia+GitHub Actions.
- Sample files for extending the theme with your own scripts and css.

On addition, `jekyll-sitemap` generates your sitemap on [./sitemap.xml](./sitemap.xml), and Chulapa generates an Atom feed on [./atom.xml](./atom.xml) and a RSS 2.0 feed on [./rss.xml](./rss.xml).

[Configure as necessary](https://dieghernan.github.io/chulapa/docs/02-config) and replace sample content with your own.
